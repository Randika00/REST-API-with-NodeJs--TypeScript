# REST-API-with-NodeJs--TypeScript

These APIs use the HTTP protocol to access and manipulate data on the server. The essential components of a REST API include the HTTP method, 
endpoint, headers, and body. REST, which stands for REpresentational State Transfer, is a software development architecture that defines a set 
of rules for communication between a client and a server.
