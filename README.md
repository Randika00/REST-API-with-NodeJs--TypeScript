REST API ðŸ•¹ðŸ§©:

These APIs use the HTTP protocol to access and manipulate data on the server. The essential components of a REST API include the HTTP method, 
endpoint, headers, and body. REST, which stands for REpresentational State Transfer, is a software development architecture that defines a set 
of rules for communication between a client and a server. 

HTTP methods ðŸŽ‡ðŸ‘“:

The HTTP method defines the action the client wants to make on the server, which includes creating, reading, updating, or deleting resources (CRUD).
Here are four HTTP methods that are commonly used in REST APIs:

    âœ¨ GET: used to retrieve resources.
    âœ¨ POST: used to add resources.
    âœ¨ PUT: used to update resources.
    âœ¨ DELETE: used to delete resources.
